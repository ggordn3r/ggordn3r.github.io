_"The 'contradiction at the heart of housing policy' is that housing in Hawaiʻi is both shelter, which we want to remain affordable, and an investment, which we want to increase in value," said Trey Gordner, UHERO policy researcher and data scientist. "If our policy goal is to increase housing affordability without harming current property owners, our main option is to build more homes, especially 'starter homes' that prioritize shelter over investment value, such as publicly subsidized for-sale units or shared equity models. This would allow first-time buyers earning local wages a chance to enter the market, build equity and thereby stay in Hawaiʻi long-term."_

_"When it comes to the building codes, it won't impact the luxury developments at all. They'll continue to build as they've always built," Gordner said. "But the further down the [annual median income] that you're trying to provide housing for, the more significant that those sorts of rules can come to — whether or not you can make the project work at all — and that's my overall concern when it comes to housing affordability."_

_A local zoning expert argued \[HB 1630\] is a monster home killer. "This is the anti-monster home bill," Hawaii Zoning Atlas director Trey Gordner said. "By breaking up those large lots and allowing for smaller units, we are actually constraining developers’ ability to build those incredibly large buildings."_

(Interview) _A collection of zoning maps of the Hawaiian islands is being compiled. It's part of the National Zoning Atlas, which helps decode confusing land-use laws. Trey Gordner, director of the Hawaiʻi Zoning Atlas, described the project as "an online interactive map that shows how zoning laws treat housing."_

_Hawaii Zoning Atlas Project Director Trey Gordner said the waitlist forces applicants to compete for a limited number of affordable housing units. Gordner said while there’s a nationwide housing shortage, Hawaii’s issue is different because of its strict zoning laws and limited land. "The real takeaway is that thousands of people are competing for hundreds of slots," Gordner said about Hawaii. "It doesn’t matter how we divvy up the tiny pie. There’s just not enough housing to go around."_

_Hawaii has some of the strictest land-use regulations in the nation, a daunting obstacle for developers and private citizens alike as they seek to build something new in the islands. To help non-experts grasp state and county zoning laws that are often muddled with jargon, a team of local experts is creating an online map called the Hawaii Zoning Atlas ... The ultimate goal, according to the project’s director Trey Gordner, is "to create interest in zoning issues and find a new way forward on housing unaffordability and inequities in the housing supply."_
