Ted Kefalas talks with Trey Gordner, a graduate student and researcher in urban and regional planning at Virginia Tech, who has been working remotely from Hawaii to create a "Hawaii Zoning Atlas."

Masters thesis defense recorded on May 9th, 2022. I studied the effects of land use regulations and how best to measure them for comparison between places and times. I proposed two new summary metrics that can be calculated from open-source GIS data, density utilization and bulk utilization. 

The basic idea behind my metrics is to calculate the percentage of the rules used by actual buildings. The closer that current buildings are to the regulatory limits, the less room there is to grow, which can lead to runaway increases in land and home prices.
