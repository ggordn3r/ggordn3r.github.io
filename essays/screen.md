#### Mapping Out Hawaii’s Housing Regulations (Hawaii Together)
**ThinkTech Hawaii** | Jun 7, 2022

Ted Kefalas talks with Trey Gordner, a graduate student and researcher in urban and regional planning at Virginia Tech, who has been working remotely from Hawaii to create a "Hawaii Zoning Atlas." Gordner hopes the new tool will help policymakers better understand the extent of Hawaii’s regulatory barriers to homebuilding and thus demonstrate the urgent need for zoning reform.

#### Regulatory Utilization: A New Way to Measure Land Use Regulations
**Virginia Tech: Masters Defense** | May 13, 2022

I studied the effects of land use regulations and how best to measure them for comparison between places and times. I proposed two new summary metrics that can be calculated from open-source GIS data, density utilization and bulk utilization. 

The basic idea behind my metrics is to calculate the percentage of the rules used by actual buildings. The closer that current buildings are to the regulatory limits, the less room there is to grow, which can lead to runaway increases in land and home prices.
